### About the theme:

This theme was made for more comfortable coding in VSCode and is experimental. This is it's very first version and the very first theme of a set.
Due to upcoming exams, new family member of the set won't be released until the I finish my exams. 
The theme was tailored for VSCode hence not compatible with other IDEs.
This is the pastel dark variant of the set.
