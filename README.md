# Bloopinku Pastel Theme v1.0.0
## Documentation
### About the theme:

This theme was made for more comfortable coding in VSCode and is experimental. This is it's very first version and the very first theme of a set.
Due to upcoming exams, new family member of the set won't be released until the I finish my exams. 
The theme was tailored for VSCode hence not compatible with other IDEs.
This is the pastel dark variant of the set.

### How to install:
#### Method 1 - Within VSCode:

* On your VSCode interface, click on the extension icon found at the left of the screen and the extension bar will open up
